  <title>Training at GE</title>
</head>
<body>
My vocational industrial training, as a part of my B. Tech. curriculum,
was at the John F. Welch Technology
Centre, GE India Technology Centre, Bangalore. I was employed as
a consultant at the Performance and Preliminary Design Technologies
(PPDT),
Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence(EACOE) under the supervision
of&nbsp; Mr. Sarat Maharana.<br>
<br>
John F. Welch Technology Centre (JFWTC) is one of the four Research and
Development centres set up by GE to aid its businesses. Established in
1999 in Bangalore, JFWTC is GE&#8217;s first and largest integrated
multidisciplinary R&amp;D centre outside US. <br>
<br>
It is an integral part of GE's Global Research organization,
collaborating with the company's other technology centres- including
its US lab in Schenectady, NY to conduct multi-disciplinary research
and development and engineering for all of GE's diverse businesses
worldwide. The Centre incorporates state-of-the-art technology and
e-Engineering tools and processes to drive real-time global interaction
with GE businesses, technology centres, customers and suppliers.<br>

About the Project</span><br>
<br>
The project assigned was a part of tools being developed at PPDT. The
tools are used to test Experimental Engine Data. The goal was to
understand and implement a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for the
observed data. Often empirical formulae are required to predict data
and to predict whether variables and attributes are important to the
empirical formulae or not. The test cases usually have a data set
ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 data points; hence it was important to
drive the attention towards the computation powers, the speed and the
accuracy of the tool developed.<br>
<br>
The GLM tool thus developed would be integrated into an existing
analysis software developed in Java.<br>
<br>
The Problem Statement was to develop a code, which has the ability to<br>
a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Compute ANCOVA tables, <br>
b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Generate Regression Analysis and <br>
c.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Perform Pairwise Comparisons.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Usage of the Tool in Aerospace</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The tool developed was very general in nature. It can be used in fields
ranging from demography, medicine, and physical analysis to high-end
engineering. Since a major portion of data variation in Aerospace is
linear in nature, this tool can be used to test huge amounts of
experimental data. Here are few of the uses of this tool.<br>
<br>
<li>ANCOVAGLM can be used to perform Engine Correlation Data
Analysis. Engine is generally manufactured and tested at the base. The
data thus collected is handed over to the customer. The customers
re-validate the data by testing the engine themselves and a correlation
is drawn based on the two sets of data obtained.</li>
<li>This tool can also be used in Engine Deterioration Analysis.
Setting an allowable limit sets a fault margin. As time progresses the
margin reduces and a prediction can be made when the engine has to be
sent for servicing. This can be used to predict a trend and thus reduce
the maintenance cost.</li>
<li>Power Calibration can be done by field regression. The power
calibration requires many settings and the tool can accurately predict
whether the setting is important or not.</li>
<li>The tool may also be used in structures to predict structural
failures. CFD data can also be analyzed using this tool and factors can
be predicted as a strong or weak influence to the dependent variable.</li>

Project Conclusion</span><br>
<br>
The output shows 100% match with the expected results.<br>
<br>
The salient features of the application can be summarized as<br>
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application can handle erroneous inputs. It
returns Garbage Value and an Error Code. (Please refer to the handbook
dealing with the Stand-Alone Executable)<br>
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application can handle any number of Covariates,
Factors and Interactions.<br>
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be embedded into any Java Code. Needs very
minor changes. (Please refer to the handbook dealing with hard-coded
Java segments and how can they be eliminated.)<br>
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Input parsed directly from a CSV file. CSV file
may have other data points, too, which are not necessary for operation.<br>
<br>
As a concluding statement, it can be said that the project was
successful and served the purpose of its creation.<br>
