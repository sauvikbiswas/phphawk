This has to be it. I don't know why but I found it easier to rhyme and
rhythm than to write exotic sentences. And thus started my journey as a
poet. I'll reserve my opportunity to state the begining for now. But I
promise to put it sometime later.<br>
<br>
I always loved the old school. I love the natural rhythm of the old
school poetry which is missing in modern ones. I don't know why but
it's very rare to find English poets these days. I think I know why. I wrote about
love, hate rage and mostly of darkness - it's something which still
allures me, waiting patiently until I step in, and I feel at home, in
familiar territory.<br>
<br>
I wrote poetry for four years, four long years until I switched the
form. I started to write lyrics for my music. I think that poetry today
exists as songs and today's poets are essentially the songwriters. This
makes me feel good, damn good. For poetry gets back to its old school
format and I'm happy about it.<br>
