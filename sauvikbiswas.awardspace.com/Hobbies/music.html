<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>I have a plethora of hobbies
and switch between them whenever something becomes boring. First thing
undoubtedly is music. I like to compose, play and record my original
stuff. Along with my schoolmate, Sudipto Biswas, I started this off as
an item of timepass. But soon it became more than that and we started
to write serious stuff. From duo we grew up into a full fledged 5-piece
band. A detailed history can be found on Dark
Project's official site <a href="http://darkproject.co.nr"

The project started off as a joke. Trying to record a song using an
unitrack recorder (???), how weird is that. We programmed a small drum
loop
and played it while I recorded the guitar arpeggios, followed by the
rhythm strums. Then we recorded the vocals. Using a software called <a
 href="http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/Products/ShowProduct.asp?PID=961%20"
 target="_blank">Soundforge</a>
we pasted them one upon the other. One mistake, undo it. Two mistakes,
gone!!! Finally used a Computer Keyboard piano and mixed it up with
rain dripping samples and thunder sounds. My gosh! The final product
was more than we could ask for. We named it "Rainwashed Bricks". <br>
<br>
I admit that the audio mixing quality back then was not that good but
it was zero on noise. Well, I said to myself and to Sudipto, "Well
Done". About 4 monts later we meet in my room and discuss the
possibilities and shortcomings and improve ourselves. We go for a
multitrack, sequencer, sampler and a distortion device to arrive at an
unplugged sounding track- "My Last Crime". It was about a person who is
repenting the murder of the woman he had loved, the murder he has
committed. It has been a 7 track EP by now, and still this one remains
close to my heart. Don't know why? Sometimes things just have no reason.<br>
<br>
We have more recently released an album "Chaos Sessions". The reording
procedure is well documented in <a target="_blank"
