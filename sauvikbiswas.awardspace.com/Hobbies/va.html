Right from the very beginning, visual arts used to allure me. I don't
know why but I found it easier to recognize shapes when I was a small kid.
My parents did see this ability in me and sent me to art schools. I
shifted here and there until I was taken in by a fine artist Subhash
Ch. Das or SubhashDa as we used to call. He taught me all about artwork
and today I credit more than four-fifth of my knowledge to him and his
efforts. <br>
<br>
Here I met two of my friends-for-life Muneshwar Rajak (aka Bhuttu) and
Mrinal Modak. We three were known as Trimurti (analogous to Three
Musketeers but a desi version.) and we used to roam around together. We
even did some collaboratrive artwork and contributed to exhibitions.
One good thing about our stuff was that, it was not some bullshit
mechanism called modern art which destroys the very basic aesthetic
sense in human beings. We were experts in collage work among our peer
groups, Bhuttu had a definite mastery over water based medium and me
over opaque pastels. We had one of the best times back then...<br>
<br>
It all started to fall apart when SubhashDa searched for jobs, and the
school that consisted of just 5-6 guys grew bigger. It eventually
collapsed. Visual Artwork took a backseat when academics took greater
proiority in our lives. After all we had seen it with our mentor. This
could earn bread but just that. We are still great friends.<br>
<br>
These days I do a lot of mixed media and illustrations and also a lot
of&nbsp; Photoshop. I like it...<br>
