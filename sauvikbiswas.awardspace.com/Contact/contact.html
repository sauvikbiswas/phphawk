<div style="margin-left: 20px;">First of all you'll need to come to
India and land in Calcutta
(now Kolkata) if you're staying abroad. Hire a taxi to take you to
Howrah Station (will cost you Rs.200|$4.50). Book a train to Kharagpur.
A detailed enquiry can be done at <a href="http://indianrail.gov.in/"
 target="_blank">http://indianrail.gov.in/</a>
(Word of advise: Beware of the pop-ups. The Indian railway is way too
poor to fund its own website). You can opt for express trains
(Rs.45|$1.00) or local trains with train numbers MH&lt;XXX&gt;
(Midnapore) or K&lt;XXX&gt; (Kharagpur) (Rs.23|$0.50). After the train
has travelled for approx. 116 Kms, unboard the train. You'll be on the <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_platform#Length"
 target="_blank">longest
platform
in this world</a> (1072 m). You have quite some options to choose from.
You can take a rickshaw (Rs.25-35|$0.50-0.80 - Negotiate). or an
AutoRickshaw (Rs.50|$1.10) and ask them to take you to Patel Hall or
wait for the institute bus to come (Rs.5|$0.10) and keep waiting. Once
you are inside the hall, the right side is the B block. Turn right,
go straight till you get a flight of stairs, climb to the 1st floor,
and
get to room no. 206. I'll be there. (If I'm out, you can safely rest in
any of my wingmates' room. They are not hostile at all.)...<br>
