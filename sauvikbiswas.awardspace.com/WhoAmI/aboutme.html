<br>
My life so far has been full of miracles. That's what makes me "Keep
the Faith" kind of a person. In reality no one knows who he is.
Instead, what one can say is what he felt about himself, others and
what others felt for him. I grew up in a small town and I am glad about
it, as it really did accelerate my freedom of thought under severe
constraints of social and political views. However it also served as a
repellent for politics and as a result I find it very hard at this
moment to develop a political view of my own. Also I could never
develop an interest in sports when I was a child, so I sought sanctuary
in fine arts and literature. It was really during my latter half of
adolscence that I got inclined to academics and music. Since then these
have become an integral part of my life. I am choosy about my friends.
I really have very few friends. I have trouble trusting people. The
good part is I hate to deciet my friends and hence I remain loyal to
those few and I'll trust them blindfolded. It's in my existence.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I love :</span> Cracking bad jokes,
soft melodic rock to heavy metal, complicated harmonies in songs, my
guitar, well-crafted thought provoking movies, B-grade movies with
loads of bad jokes, wasting time on useless things that harness
creativity, sitting infront of my computer even if I have nothing to do
with it, people who are straightforward (I even forgive them even if
they go against me) and darkness.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I hate :</span> Hypocrisy, spending time on looking good (me, a Homersexual??), crowded places, unfair means, people, esp. girls, who are obsessed with the last letter of the alphabet and endz up wiz linez lk dizz, and people who assume that the person listening to you has lesser knowledge and can easily skip the bare minimum that he deserves to know..<br>
<br>
I have never been on the gray scale of life. For me it's all about two
ends of the line. Even my friends complain that I should stop being an
extremist. Maybe its like the conscience of Eric Cartman - absent.<br>
