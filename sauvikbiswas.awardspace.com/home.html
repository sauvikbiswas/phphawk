Hi everyone! I am Sauvik alias 54UV1K and this is my website. This
website contains my likes, my dislikes, my views, my opinions and my
justifications. This website also contains links to certain things
which I believe will do the internet community some good in general.
Well, I believe it's not always too late to start following someone's
footsteps. What do you say?<br>
<br>
I have tried to keep this website as simple as possible. The navigation
can be done using the menus available on the left hand side. I hope
you'll find me interesting. If it's true post a guestbook entry. If
it's untrue do post a guestbook entry.<br>
<br>
This website is built using a small powerful tool called EasySITE which
is a small script which has been written by me so that using a small
wysiwyg editor and this software, even a newbie can create a personal
website with easy navigability and customizable looks. A highly
modified and customized copy of this software can be found on Avik
Sarkar's official site. (Check out the links page.)<br>
