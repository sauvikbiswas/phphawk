  <title>Academics</title>

<body>
Hello! Are you guys listening? This is me again. Well, I was not that
interested in academics until, um... until.. I was in my 9th standard.
The reason of which I myself don't know - and that's partially true. I
suddenly developed a nice interest in my studies. (It doesn't mean that
I was a bad student after all. I used to secure 75% without even
studying properly.) Partially because I was motivated, and partially
because of lack of motivation in my other areas of interest which at
that time was literature and painting. <br>
<br>
I don't remember much of those
days that is worth sharing over here but just for the record I studied
at St. Mary's High School, Coochbehar. Now, Coochbehar (aka Koch Bihar,
West Bengal) is a nice place to study with 4 govt. WBSE/WBCHSE schools,
2 non-govt. WBSE/WBCHSE schools, 1 ICSE/ISC school (St. Mary's) and 1
CBSE school (Kendriya Vidyalaya). Apart from that there are 3 govt.
colleges, an evening college and a Polytechnic. So much for such a
small town. <br>
<br>
When my board examinations for 10th was over, I had to go to some place
else to find an ISC school (Back then our school was affiliated only
till 10th standard. The 12th recognition came a year after our batch
had left.) So I went to Siliguri (A better town nearby, soon developing
into a city.) in search of schools and despite my good academic
achievement (91%), I was unable to find one. Today I thank my destiny
for that trick but back then I was surely a bit disappointed. There
were no ISC schools which offered science and were open to outsiders at
that point of time.<br>
<br>
With a hell lot of disappointment I came back to
Coochbehar, thought for a while and made up my mind to join the CBSE
school that was there - Kendriya Vidyalaya. Now this school had a
notorious record of a below average academic performance on an average
but at the same time, there were students who made sure that the below
average score of this school was compensated. With a little help from
my friends I was able to make up my mind. Even they faced the same
situation.<br>
<br>
Getting into KV was not that hard, considering the fact that my father
was a Central Government employee. Almost all of my friends got
through.
So, it was us, the St. Mary's guys and the old KV guys and a third
bunch from KV Alipurduar (lack of 12th affiliation). The situation was
tense, hostile and kind of humorous. Well, in due corse of time, a lot
happend, hostility vapourized, etc. etc. The important thing to note is
that, although this might deserve some 3 to 4 chapters in my biography
yet this should not be a point of discussion at this moment.<br>
<br>
During my 11th studies, I had a really wonderful opportunity and
previlege to be mentored by four most amazing teachers. Shankar Sir
taught me Physics, AjayDa taught me Chemistry, JayantaDa taught me
Mathematics and PathoDa taught me Biology. (The -Da suffix is actually
for <span style="font-style: italic;">dada</span>, meaning <span
 style="font-style: italic;">elder brother</span> in Bengali. Indeed,
they were like my elder brothers.) I give full credit to my four elder
brothers who made me come here, a rare previlege for a small town guy
to get into IITs. <br>
<br>
Five years at IIT pursuing a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech in 5 years)
is a hell lot of taxation on physical and mental status. Due to this,
you might find me eccentric, but I don't bite. I have recently
completed my formal education and have applied for a PhD.<br>
<br>
As we say, IITians are like Scotch and Wine, they get
better with old age. I'm yet to experience that.<br>
