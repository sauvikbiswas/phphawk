His skills are not only limited to the bass but he is a good guitar player as well. Niki hails from the city of Kolkata but is currently based out of Bangalore. A genius on the football ground, Niki has taken the game to new heights in his school as well as his college. He supports the English Premier League side Chelsea with his true heart and loves swimming whenever he gets time. Niki presently uses a Tronad for the bass and is given a new dimension to Dark Project's bass playing. He is planning to switch gears soon.
