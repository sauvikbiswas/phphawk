Sauvik picked up the guitar when he was in school. He has a very wide dimension to his musical taste that ranges from Savage Garden to Rush to Porcupine Tree to Cynic. An artist, in it's true sense, Sauvik loves painting sketches in his free time. A proclaimed GE3K, he is the backbone of the band, taking care of all the engineering and technical nuances. He loves eating Chinese food and digs reading graphic novels. He is a fan of Christopher Nolan and his movies. Sauvik uses a POD XT Studio with his Shectar along with a small foot controller during the Live Shows.
