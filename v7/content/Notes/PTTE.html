The song thrives on the progression which forms the backbone of this intrumental. Sauvik came up with the arpeggio and sequenced the strings. Arunava came up with a really complex drum sequence which evolves with every measure. Although this song is short, it took more than average time to compose and record. It was really hard for Baka to come up with a progression on the bass that wouldn't clutter the instrumental. Ugyal provided the final piece of the puzzle by playing a vocalesque lead over the progression.<br>
This song is the shape of things to come.<br>
