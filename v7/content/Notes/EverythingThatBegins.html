This was the last track composed for this album. The band was looking to have one track to set the mood for the album. It was also a necessity that it would not play for more than 2 minutes. The vocals are synthesised and artificially phased. This track is entirely programmed and sequenced and doesn't contain any real instruments (what so ever), unlike the rest of the album.<br>
