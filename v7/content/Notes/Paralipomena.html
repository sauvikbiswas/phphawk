The weirdest of progressions worked on a totally progressive track on this album, is what this song has been. Sauvik and Ugyal both struggled in picking a suitable bass pattern for the song and had to do away with simple notes because of the scale variations that it has. Paralipomena is a tough word to choose for a song but Sauvik vouched for the name. Paralipomena means things that are omitted or neglected that are added as a supplement. Originally taken and modified from one of the old poetries of Sauvik which was written on 7th September 1999 when he was in his 10th grade. The vocal for this song were recorded at one shot and was an alibi for a dedicated practice that Sudipto had to put in for it before the recording sessions.<br>
