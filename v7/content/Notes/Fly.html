This is a song about seeing the dreams come true in a flash. Maybe not in reality but once you get a little anesthetic and all of a sudden see the things you have always imagined. You start to wonder if it's for real or not, but you only pray that you live it on and fly. This song was conceived on a dull morning back in June 2008 by Sudipto. He had composed the song on his guitar and he wrote the lyrics on the back of an envelope. This (the track, not the envelope!) was sent to Sauvik and Ugyal who were having a jam session at Kharagpur. The arrangement was made around the bass groove Sauvik came up with. The song had minimal of guitars in it and was given a heavenly treatment where Sauvik made a voice synthesis software speak the words to start with. This song also has a sample from the movie "Once". In case you guys missed it, it is the commotion on the street which is liberally extracted. We could have lifted that sound from anywhere else, but then how would we be able to say that it is one of our favourite movies.<br>
