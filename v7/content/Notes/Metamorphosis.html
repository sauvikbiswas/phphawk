Life is all about bondage and boundaries just like the life of a caterpillar, which has to remain in the limitations despite of the fact that it knows, the world outside is crying out to break, but still it feels that something is going to liberate him.<br>
<br>
Butterfly is symbolic to freedom, an independence which is long earned. Mapped to the life of a human being broken off from all types of bondages that this world imposes.<br>
