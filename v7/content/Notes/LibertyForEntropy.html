This song was made on a progressive note as well. This song filled the place of the last song that the band was searching to complete the whole album. The lyrics of the song speak about the struggles in life and how one inspires himself to just cling on to his beliefs and fight on. Ugyal fiddled around with chunks of related arpeggiated progressions while Sauvik came up with a tune and lyrics. Ugyal overdubbed the track with a nice, smooth and melancholy guitar that in places sound like disc scratches. This song is the last vocal track recorded for this album. Needless to say Liberty for Entropy was a big inspiration behind naming the album as Liberty and Entropy! In case if you have really missed out on the title - Liberty is your controlled freedom, one that has rules bound by the society, the state or by yourself; while Entropy is your uncontrolled freedom, the natural tendency of us, human beings (or any system) to move into disorder.<br>
