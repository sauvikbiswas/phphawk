This song has a sarcastic take on the state of our society and on our generation that is slowly becoming a part of a rat race without having the concern regarding some of the basic
needs in life. We are all caught up in the web of earning money and forget about the real meaning of life as we base our promises on false truth. As we look up to a fake upwards "North" on profit curves and try to be the "Jack" of all trades, we realise that this is really not society as it should function - but a battlefield.<br>

The song started off with a "Indianized" riff composed by Ugyal and gradually evolved as each of the band members had a significant contribution to compliment it. This song marks the comeback of Dark Project into the independent music circuit after a break of almost close to 2 years.<br>
