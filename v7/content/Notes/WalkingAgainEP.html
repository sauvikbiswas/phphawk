This song was liked by many owing to the great intro and the catchy tune. But we felt that the original single was too long to fit properly into the EP. After some discussion we thought of splitting the original song into two and editing it a bit so that when played continuously, it will still feel like the long old version playing. And on the other hand, it will be more radio friendly as an edit.<br>We believe that was a brilliant idea<br>
