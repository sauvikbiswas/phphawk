This is a track almost made in a whiz. Ugyal did most of the composition on this one. He had sketched it out almost in its entirety long before he landed in Kharagpur for the recording session. This was a part of the tracking spree where the guys belted out a chunk of songs at the same time. Ugyal played the fastest guitar lead of his career on this one. Actually, they fiddled around with the tempo, increased it in steps and reached a point beyond which the lead would get jarry and noisy, not to mention, unplayable. It actually took quite a number of takes to get to perfection. The song was later completed with the lyrics and theme during the vocal recording sessions in Oct 2008. This is a track which is almost unlike Dark Project. Inspiration from 3 Doors Down, the USP for the track is its various alleys that it covers through the entire song. Oh, yes! Thanks Russell for the Acoustic Guitar.<br>
