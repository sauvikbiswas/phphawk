A story of a soldier fighting a war within himself, trying to discover the cause for his survival. Until he gets shot and is haunted by the ill feelings of the cause and its consequences. The Song is a conversation between a man and his self reflection. A discovery which makes him more inclined towards leaving this world as he asks for 50 ml of morphine from his captain, which would surely kill him.<br>

This song took the longest time in its production. Sauvik concieved the idea of depicting the story of a soldier who fought 10 years of his life fighting a war all for political reasons and without knowing his destiny. He intially came up with the lyrics for the repeat verse until it took Sudipto to write the whole body of the song which eventually became an asset to the band. Ugyal had his mouth organ in the guitar pack, and these guys were stuck with idea of including it in the song. The orchestration of the song took a lot of time.Although the band wanted to have no drums in the song, but Sauvik's idea of introducing it right at the end during the guitar leads really payed rich dividends. Baka had a tough time recording the bass because it was to play a important role in the song as it was mostly void of drums. This, a vocal oriented song, according to Ugyal is Sudipto's best effort in the album. The Song already raised eyebrows in its pre-production as those who heard it claimed it to be the band's best effort till date.<br>
