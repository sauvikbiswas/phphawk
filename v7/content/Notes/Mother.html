This song was the first one concieved and recorded for the album "Chaos Sessions". The band wanted to start off the writing process with something that would be quite different from their earlier efforts. It was the month of june and the band members were in a mood of relaxation from their academic pressures. Sauvik suddenly came upto the band mates and said "lets make a song about Sudipto's mother". Who else other than Sudipto could have expressed his feeings for his mother. He came up with the lyrics of the song, the band backed him more than hundred percent to come up with a heavy chorus for the song. The song talks about the struggle Sudipto's mother did for him through their bad days of evil and the worse.<br>

This song although is specifically written, has a very generic and universal feel to it. In the end it describes the feelings of a person, where he tries to look back at the sacrifices his mother has made for him, the struggle that she once put forward for her son despite the world being against her, and he is fighting every moment to tell her that her prayers were worth it.<br>

Armed with a demo mix of this song, the band members landed up in Kolkata and went hunting for a studio to record the album. After visiting many of the "top-notch" studios, they realized that their own make shift studios in hostel rooms equipped with budget peripherals and creatures with superior intelligence are better than expensive equipments operated by orthodox minds. (Few engineers were really helpful but most of them were of this category). Some wise guy said "An engineer recording in a farm house is better than a monkey let loose in Abbey Roads".<br>
