The song deals with a person who is split into living in two worlds simultaneosly, where on one hand a face is a make up of all that he isnt and the other one faces reality. It reflects the story of a face actor who has to hide 
himself from this world to have his living. Its his burden to put on a mask and entertain even at times when his life is in despair.<br>

Sauvik and his hostel wingie came up with this idea of making a guitar overdrive by themselves. After comimg up with the unit Sauvik was almost desperate to make a head banger with it somehow. He tested certain chord sequences and harmonics with Arunava in the music room and they came up with the opening track "Cover Up". Baka's baseline is a noticeble part of the song. Ugyal's entry with the guitar is a treat to listen as the band uses "dual" leads for the song.<br>
By the way... did you like the Tom Morello influence??<br>
