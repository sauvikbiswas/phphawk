This is probably the strongest composition of this album. The track was initially sketched by Sauvik in around June 2008. Sudipto was returning after seeing "The Happening", though unmoved by the movie, he felt this track to be more like a soundtrack. (In a way, we all perceive a cumulative compendium of senses rather than singular signals from our sense organs, don't we?) Ugyal joined in Sauvik and gave it good harmonic touches. The riffs on the chorus were made heavier than its mother composition and Sudipto did a good job with the vocals to complete the whole picture. The triple repeat of the chorus towards the end was recorded in one take (Sudipto had a nice lung exercise there). This is one of the psychedelic tracks of the album and is definitely one of the "repeat plays" from the whole set. As per Sudipto, this is the best lyrically written song of the entire album.<br>
