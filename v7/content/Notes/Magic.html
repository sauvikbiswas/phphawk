Magic is a word that means something special, something that is out of the ordinary. After living our lives in a hiatus for over 1 and half years, we realized the importance of this band in our lives. The song is inspired by a piano doodle from Adriana that came out of a Random Jam over a Video Chat. The words of the song describe the celebration of a relationship that exists all around us. The moment we realize the importance of it - nothing but 'Magic' Happens! Through this song we want to appeal to each of our listeners to not give up on their dreams.<br>
