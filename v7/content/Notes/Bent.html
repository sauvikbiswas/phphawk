With relationships getting into a turmoil and distance killing the liberty, you almost end up seeing the truth. This is a song which speaks about seeing the inevitable and yet not getting shaken or intimidated by something which is not very pleasant. In March 2008, Sudipto had made a piece on arpeggiated acoustic guitar. Somehow, the feel didn't match the texture of the song. Sauvik came up with the piano parts and sequencing of the song while Ugyal added textures (and a nice outro) to it with his guitar. Watch out for Sudipto's melancholic voice.<br>
