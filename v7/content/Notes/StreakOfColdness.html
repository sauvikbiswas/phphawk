Streak of Coldness happens to be the first track recorded for this album.  The idea came out of a delay patch on Sauvik's guitar, with Ugyal playing stop / block riffs in the background. A demo version of the song was initially recorded back in September 2007, just after Sudipto had left for Bangalore. Sauvik and Ugyal worked out the initial track and had sent it to Sudipto via an e-mail. Much to the liking, three of them sat together in November 2007 at Jadavpur University's main hostel to come up with the lyrics and the vocals for the song. One year later, the riffs were re-recorded with a guitar amp and the vocals were recorded as well. This song is a complete blend of New Age rock with a Pink Floyd delay patch. People started to like it even before it was completely made, which would eventually lead to this becoming the first single of the new album. And of course, it emerges from the pad noise of the previous track in D minor.<br>
