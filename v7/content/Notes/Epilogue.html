There is a subtle beauty in this track that no one can deny. It has a weird programmed rhythm, backed up by a CP80, powerful, stripped down vocals, a string assembly and turntable scratches on top as the icing. What's more interesting is that we came up with this track in just one night.<br>The noise was added later to give the song a sense of completion in context with the EP, linking back to the opening track.<br>
