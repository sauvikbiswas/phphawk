Alone was written in 2005 and was recorded in January 2006. This is a story of a man spending a day in a mental asylum, where he was betrayed and sent for all the wrong reasons. We tried experimenting with complex recording methods to come up with this track. Untill this point we didn't have a full fledged band to start off.<br><br>Someone told us a few days ago that there is this guy called Arunava Chakrabarti who wants to join the project.<br>
