Life makes a person cross limitations, do the unthinkable only to find that his sacrifices are not worth more than few drops of rain which makes him wet and drenched instead of fullfilling his thrust.<br>

This song is a rework from their previous EP. It was Ugyal's idea to revive few of the old tracks from the "Dark Project EP" especially Drenched, Walking again and My Last Crime. Due to the time limitations the band couldn't work on all the three. Drenched was the song picked up because of its tempo but Sauvik decided to change the Key of the song. The target was to give a more organic feeling to the song. Ugyal came up with an arpeggio sequence doubling the sample and a longer lead.<br>
