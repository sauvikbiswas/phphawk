Our old friend Rakesh would term this one to be some racing game soundtrack. This again is an entirely progressive instrumental track on the album. One can almost imagine a chase on foot slowly giving way to a car chase until the car loses balance and skyrockets out into the valley, suspending itself in the air in bullet time. Covah spelt backward means Havoc, which defines the sound of this song. This song was initially named "Bhootia"(Ghostly in Hindi, Bengali and a lot of other Sanskrit derived languages) due to the haunting start it had. Later the intro of the song was removed and it eventually lead to Sauvik's new name, ShriMahan Geek v0.02, which incidentally has no relationship whatsoever with the existence of the song or the absence of the intro (one that no one will ever hear again).<br>
