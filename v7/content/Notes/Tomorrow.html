In a chaotic world like today our only hope is to hold on to the overated promises that are made by the dreams that we force ourselves to see. It's high time when we learn that these illusions might just be the a curtain raiser for the payback for our sins, tommorrow.<br>

Sauvik and Chaks were sitting in their hostel room and trying to figure out a new song when the lights went out. Sauvik kept plucking on his acoustic guitar and accidently discovered the introductory sequence. In reality, its just a misplaced chord.<br>
The entire verse is composed and written by Sauvik and Chaks. The song talks about the days of darkness that are ahead of the human race. It is the simplest of the songs in this album. Sudipto came up with the repeat verse of the song. While making the song the band knew it had to be the closing track of the album. As short and simple the song is, the lyrics are equally deep and makes the listener think not about the future but the current state of human existence.<br>
