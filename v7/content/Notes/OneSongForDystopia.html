This was initially called the Cocktail of Confusion. Sauvik had come up the riff for the song as well as the idea of the dual lead, which he had mailed Sudipto back in March 2008. Sauvik almost discarded the track until Sudipto insisting the guys to work on the same. Ugyal joined the party and came up with a Morello inspired lead for the song. The song has a little Maiden touch in between, but the lick of the song comes from the Harmonica played by Ugyal right at the end. It seems like a worthy wait for this 5 minute war imagination. The lyrics is inspired from the novel The Carhullan Army by Sarah Hall. You might find the book in some places as Daughters of the North. It talks about a war ridden place where solace was just a dream or as we say it - it's etched in the stars.<br>
