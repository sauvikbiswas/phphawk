This track is dedicated to the politics around us and is for the first time that Dark Project took this risk of covering a song on this theme. Risk because there are  already have a zillion of compositions on the same line. Rather it was challenging for us to really stand out with a composition on such a topic. A scratch version featuring a rough layout was brought by Ugyal as a video recorded on his cellphone. Again very unlike Dark Project, Ugyal was shocked after the vocals were recorded to see his own creation land up in such a shape. According to him, it sounded more like Iron Maiden meeting RATM kind of song.<br>
