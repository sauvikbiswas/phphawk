This was the second song we ever wrote. It was recorded in August 2004. With a heavily stipped down approach towards song making, this song is completely void of drums. However, it makes sure that the listener gets glued to us. A personal favourite, this song describes a homicide plot and its execution.<br>Listen closely and it will grow on you.<br>
