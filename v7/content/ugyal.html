Ugyal hails from the city of Darjeeling, West Bengal. He can play almost any instrument under the sun. Ugyal learnt the first stint of his music from his father at home.  Since then it's been a long journey full of shows with various bands, across various venues. Ugyal has a knack of picking up any song of any genre in a matter of seconds (and any musical instrument he can lay his hands on). In his spare time, Ugyal plays football, watches football and eats a lot of momos. Ugyal's favorite bands are Rush, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Megadeth and Guns 'N Roses. His hold in classical guitar styles blended with Sauvik's soulful doodles, gives Dark Project a unique sound. Ugyal uses his Custom made guitar with the D'Marzio Pickups along with a small arsenal of Boss Peddles during the live gigs.
