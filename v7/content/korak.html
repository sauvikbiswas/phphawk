Korak hails from Garia in Kolkata and is currently doing his MS in Aerospace Engineering from IISc Bangalore. He has played drums for an innumerable number (oxymoron alert!) of bands in the past and was regarded as one of the best amateur drummers of Kolkata. Although he is fascinated by glam rock bands like Skidrow, Steelheart, Motley Crue, Cinderella, Extreme, Firehouse, Whitesnake, Poison, etc. yet his favourite bands are Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Megadeth. These are his absolute favourites and in that specific order, all other bands go into the 4th position, because he just loves so many of them. A true adventure lover - he loves riding his bikes to the distance, all across the country. He only gets high with good music and has a tremendous sense of picking up any song in a matter of seconds. Korak uses a TAMA with Sabian Cymbals as a part of his arsenal. Korak's doesn't have a lucky number.
