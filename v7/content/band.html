"A <i>project</i> aimed at the formation of the band" - Dark Project  was always subscripted with this tagline in it's inception years  (2002-2005); the years  when Sauvik and Sudipto graduated from school and ventured out to  discover their  interest in making music. In 2005, the tagline lost the value because  the  project reached it's completion. A band was formed with 5 people in it.  Meanwhile, the song, 'Walking Again' had gained quite a bit of a  listener  base.<br>

Dark Project is an English band that composes music that  can be classified as an approximate blend of Alternative and Progressive Rock. However,  the band doesn't believe in this distinction while creating any of their  stuff. The band found it's ground in the year 2007, when they came out  with their first offering in the form of a 9 song album titled <i>Chaos  Sessions</i>. It was aptly dedicated to the chaotic noises the band produced  while jamming and making this record in the hostel corridors of Patel  Hall of Residence, IIT Kharagpur. The band had already garnered interest and  had started playing live.<br>

Dark Project became one of the highest played Indian bands on CBS's <a href="http://last.fm/" target="_blank">last.fm</a>  in the year 2007-08. 'Cover Up', '50 ML', 'Mother' and  'Caterpillar/Butterfly' were notable numbers from Chaos Session that  found an appreciator in the audience because of their thematic approach  to each of the songs. The limited print of Chaos Sessions was sold off  in months time. Also at this time, the band was struggling with the  geographical boundaries as  the band got split between Kolkata and Bangalore.<br>
<br>
Amidst all the adversity, they did not want to stop  the production mill and Dark Project came out with their second full  length album titled as Liberty &amp; Entropy in the year 2009. The plans  were certainly bigger this time. The album was released on iTunes,  Amazon and CD baby for the international audience and was available via  VPP to the Indian audiences. The packaging of the album was an eye  opener for many - something which was not done by any other band in  India in the past. The single 'Streak Of Coldness' got played on  multiple radio stations in India. The album was eventually reviewed by  the Rolling Stone Magazine, Rock Street Journal, IndiarockMp3,  Indiescion, etc. who published their polarising views about it.<br>
<br>
The band played quite a few shows in the whole  process and was also a part of the Pub Rock Fest in the year 2009  conducted by RSJ. Later in the year, Sudipto had to fly out of the  country for his work commitments and the band decided to go on a  hiatus. For the past 3 months, the band has been working to prepare  themselves for another album cycle. Their geographical boundaries are sorted out  after a long wait of 5 years as 4 of it's members are based out of a  Bangalore now and Sauvik is planning to join in soon.<br>

The story narrated above has more to it than just the words - Dark  Project is not just a band, it's a relationship that has survived,  struggled and bruised through the odds. While some of us who know the  band might get a little swayed by the individual careers that the band  members have under them, music is still the one thing that each and  everyone of the band members consider as their thing to happiness in  life. Even with a limited English music listener base in the country,  Dark Project wants to inspire people through their work as they prepare  themselves up for a comeback that only reads - Follow your dreams, no  matter how bad the situations get, feel the 'Magic' that happens because  of it.<br>
