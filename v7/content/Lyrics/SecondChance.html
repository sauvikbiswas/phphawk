Every day it goes on and on.
And Dusk to dawn I feel overhauled.
Like a rail fixed on the tracks,
Everyday I trace them back.
As I try to face the battle<br>
Catering my banal needs,<br>
Existence is a formal question<br>
Pending answers I must seek.<br>
<br>
Now would you stop me?<br>
I wanna find me running from the lie and reach the truth.<br>
<br>
Need a second chance to find suspended bliss of mine.<br>
Need a second life to seek where beauty hides no lies.<br>
<br>
Once I want to stop the clock<br>
Freeze the motion freeze the thoughts.<br>
Alter bits and pieces of things I hated, things I lost.<br>
As I try to make tomorrow,<br>
write the chances for myself.<br>
Dream a world I want to live in<br>
Paint a canvas void of gray.<br>
<br>
Now would you stop me?<br>
I wanna find me running from the lie and reach the truth.<br>
<br>
And I will show you a world I made for myself.<br>
A world I made for the both of us to be ourselves.<br>
And I will carry all the burdens with a smile.<br>
All these tiny shoulders can until the force breaks them.<br>
Would you go?<br>
<br>
Need a second chance to find suspended bliss of mine.<br>
Need a second life to seek where beauty hides no lies.<br>
<br>
Now would you stop me?<br>
I wanna find me running from the lie and reach the truth.<br>
