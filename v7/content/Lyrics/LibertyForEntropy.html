Rushed to make a mark before I'm dead<br>
And left footprints on the river bed.<br>
Overflowed and washed them all away.<br>
<br>
And a voice inside me<br>
Said I must cling on.<br>
Not to lose my balance,<br>
Not to stop, dream on.<br>
And a voice inside me said<br>
Not to run out of breath.<br>
<br>
I wish you would understand.<br>
Why I'm sinking in this sand.<br>
I just want to be me.<br>
If I wish to be free.<br>
Liberty for Entropy.<br>
<br>
Wish to be someone before I'm gone.<br>
Leave a part of me as a song.<br>
One last rhyme to wipe it all away.<br>
<br>
This choked voice inside me<br>
Says I must live on.<br>
Not to lose myself,<br>
Not to halt, dream on.<br>
And a voice inside me said<br>
Not to run out of breath.<br>
<br>
I wish you would understand.<br>
Why I'm sinking in this sand.<br>
I just want to be me.<br>
If I wish to be free.<br>
Liberty for Entropy.<br>
