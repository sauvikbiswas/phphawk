<b>Caterpillar</b><br>
<br>
I think that I have felt it too much<br>
More than just my name.<br>
I swear by God I have this feeling<br>
I need you to explain<br>
<br>
All I want is to face the mirror,<br>
He who wears no shame<br>
Trying to break this bondage<br>
My chrysallis to shed.<br>
<br>
And this world is getting darker every moment<br>
Like the clouds in a summer sky.<br>
And the walls that I build around myself<br>
And hope that I will fly.<br>
<br>
It's been too late and makes me feel that<br>
The dusk is in the air<br>
I'll be waiting for the moonlight<br>
To navigate my way<br>
<br>
Every minute is stretching hard<br>
Growing in a shape<br>
Trying to break this bondage<br>
My chrysallis to shed.<br>
<br>
And this world is getting darker every moment<br>
Like the clouds in a summer sky.<br>
And the walls that I build around myself<br>
And hope that I will fly.<br>
<br>
This world has got darker at this moment<br>
A truth that I can't deny<br>
This wall that I've build around myself...<br>
And tomorrow I will fly<br>
<br>
<br><b>Butterfly</b><br>
<br>
Hardened memories long lost gone<br>
Like a brook life carries on.<br>
Love and faith is bondage,<br>
Sans no faith its too long.<br>
<br>
In my time of vexed up days,<br>
Pointed fingers, thoughts malign...<br>
If this beauty is skin deep,<br>
Ugliness will poison thine.<br>
<br>
No more clouds in summer sky,<br>
No more walls enclose myself,<br>
A pair of wings in open fields,<br>
No more breeze that goes unfelt.<br>
<br>
Made a promise to myself,<br>
Never to die in sorrow.<br>
Freedom of this moment<br>
Is worth the death tomorrow.<br>
