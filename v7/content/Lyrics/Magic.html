I was high in the sky above my thoughts.<br>
Without my wings, still I could sing<br>
The song of our souls.<br>
<br>
Echoes of silent voices reflected off the air.<br>
Once we all sang to the tunes<br>
We left the world to stare.<br>
<br>
(The) Magic happens all around me,<br>
And it never stops to cheer destiny.<br>
Louder till they get to hear us<br>
And we never stop,<br>
We sound like a symphony.<br>
<br>
We made a choice.<br>
To walk together to fill the void.<br>
So much to cover.<br>
Let the faith take this over now, is so what I feel when we sing.<br>
<br>
(The) Magic happens all around me,<br>
And it never stops to cheer destiny.<br>
Louder till they get to hear us<br>
And we never stop,<br>
We sound like a symphony.<br>
<br>
Can you sense the spark of life?<br>
Like a sparkle in our eyes.<br>
We dig the grave of sadness and dance into the night.<br>
There is one thing that remains<br>
A painted portrait of our souls.<br>
All the while, and never again,<br>
No sorrow or no pain, as we sing.<br>
<br>
(The) Magic happens all around me,<br>
And it never stops to cheer destiny.<br>
Louder till they get to hear us<br>
And we never stop,<br>
We sound like a symphony.<br>
