It's just that time,<br>
When you crawl for the touch of the light<br>
Behind the bars,<br>
You feel that it's your best place to hide<br>
<br>
Emptiness and the growing void<br>
There's so much to pour your heart<br>
It's the worst when it turns you down,<br>
The one trust you had put once aside.<br>
<br>
Contemplation, Liberation<br>
Reaching and paying<br>
These soul consolations<br>
Truly and fairly<br>
I think you've tasted,<br>
This ain't no broken, no admiration.<br>
<br>
There was one time<br>
Leaves were green and flowers had smiled??<br>
The shade of light<br>
Fell on you, made you see in the night.<br>
<br>
It's so hard to tell yourself<br>
And it grows in your head.<br>
I'm as ordinary as you look<br>
Why don't you break my hooks.<br>
<br>
Contemplation, Liberation<br>
Reaching and paying<br>
These soul consolations<br>
Truly and fairly<br>
I think you've tasted,<br>
This ain't no broken, no admiration.<br>
