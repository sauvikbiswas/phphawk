I can see it come, straight without a bend-<br>
I would face it over me, will not shake.<br>
Compromise. I have learned to leave.<br>
The best in me is scared again.<br>
<br>
And I will shake without breaking.<br>
And I am momentarily caught in this misery.<br>
<br>
Tuning forks making resonant noise<br>
Its hitting my pride, someone's telling again.<br>
(Like) radio waves, condolence spreads.<br>
Its seeking a ear to hear the forbidden pain.<br>
<br>
And I will shake without breaking.<br>
And I am momentarily caught in this misery.<br>
<br>
And now it pulls me near my death<br>
Like I would be free.<br>
Then the wind will blow you away<br>
spread the smell of my soul.<br>
So there is no complication-<br>
No more bargain for peace.<br>
You would try to seek but you'll find<br>
Its not in me, its not in me.<br>
<br>
Will shake without breaking.<br>
And I am momentarily caught...<br>
