In my life I've felt the pain,<br>
Torn myself hard through the Sun and the rain,<br>
I knew I would fall apart if it goes on like this.<br>
I knew I would lose my faith, but I had your love as a gain.<br>
<br>
In my life I've sold myself,<br>
Twisted fate and the junk of hell.<br>
Memoires of you shelved on racks reminds me of you again.<br>
Tucked in closet, hiding them all - Would I have you alive again?<br>
<br>
This boy was tough,<br>
Was a little bit rough -<br>
He tried real hard to understand her.<br>
The morning came,<br>
The sun was the same<br>
But she left him alone; she was running for fame.<br>
<br>
I am a soldier who's fighting alone<br>
With the shadow he casts on walls.<br>
When the morning sun is gone I'll come to see you again.<br>
When the night gives way to the dawn, no one would see you again.<br>
<br>
Crucified by the thoughts of her, I tried to catch my breath again.<br>
Coming from this world of dreams, I feel my senses are numb again.<br>
<br>
Numb again....<br>
