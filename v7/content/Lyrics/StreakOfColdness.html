It's a fragile moment, a weight of frail,<br>
A depth of ocean hides the veil.<br>
Strange you aren't a stranger now<br>
My truth hurts but you disavow<br>
It's an inner madness pulling under<br>
Taking over thoughts of mine<br>
Have this darkness hid inside<br>
Can't you see the light?<br>
<br>
Is this the child of madness?<br>
Is this the way of life?<br>
Is love the hate I'm feeling?<br>
Sends a shiver down the spine.<br>
Is reciprocation the only way love survives?<br>
Is this a shock I'm sensing?<br>
Sends a chill down the spine.<br>
Set me free. (Streak of coldness down the spine.)<br>
Let me fly. (Streak of coldness down the spine.)<br>
Hold me now. (Streak of coldness down the spine.)<br>
With these lies. (Streak of coldness down the spine.)<br>
<br>
Torn between the heart and mind<br>
One to choose and one to blame.<br>
But if you would want me to I'll play this game, play this game.<br>
<br>
It's a fragile moment floating over<br>
Fragile thoughts of consciousness.<br>
Never they want to set me free.<br>
Truth may hurt but I disagree.<br>
It's an inner sanctum pulling me inside<br>
Nurturing my existence.<br>
Walking the tunnel, it's dark inside.<br>
But can't you see that light?<br>
<br>
Is this the child of madness?<br>
Is this the way of life?<br>
Is love the hate I'm feeling?<br>
Sends a shiver down the spine.<br>
Is reciprocation the only way love survives?<br>
Is this a shock I'm sensing?<br>
Sends a chill down the spine.<br>
Set me free. (Streak of coldness down the spine.)<br>
Let me fly. (Streak of coldness down the spine.)<br>
Hold me now. (Streak of coldness down the spine.)<br>
With these lies. (Streak of coldness down the spine.)<br>
