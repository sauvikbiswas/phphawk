&gt;&gt; This is a routine procedure.<br>
You will be hypnotised to feel happy. Feel happy. Feel happy... &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Sometimes you work it out<br>
Inside your mighty thoughts.<br>
You are with the wings in the back<br>
Floating in the seventh sky.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of bridges crossed<br>
Miles flown in a spark of thought.<br>
Holy grave is destiny<br>
You cry for it I fight for all.<br>
<br>
Can you see it come over you<br>
The light is calling you up, up to the moon.<br>
Nebula's burning up in the sky<br>
No wonder you think now what went right!<br>
<br>
You made many promises<br>
It took so long to contemplate.<br>
This baggage is full of lies  <br>
Extrapolating as the time went by.<br>
<br>
Can you see it come over you?<br>
The light is calling you up, up to the moon.<br>
Nebula's burning up in the sky.<br>
No wonder you think now what went right!<br>
No wonder you think now what went right!<br>
<br>
You sit  and write your songs,<br>
They are your dreams, your prayers to God.<br>
Holy grave is destiny<br>
You cry for it, I give it all.<br>
<br>
(What went right?) I can see the light is calling.<br>
(I wanna fly.) I can hear the cacophony.<br>
(Is it right?) Earth bound human freedom.<br>
(I will fly.) Yeah!<br>
<br>
Can you see it come over you?<br>
The light is calling you up to the moon.<br>
Nebula's burning up in the sky.<br>
No wonder you think what went right!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Wake up. Wake up. Wake up... &lt;&lt;<br>
