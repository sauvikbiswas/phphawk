<i>[Prelude]</i><br>
Wasted soul can't fight anymore.<br>
Fatal dreams of hopeless love<br>
And miles of empty road.<br>
The evil mind must fade away with time.<br>
Rise above the endless thoughts<br>
And let the peace reside.<br>
<br>
All alone in the desert road<br>
Lost their souls and lost the hopes<br>
I will find my way to you someday.<br>
<br>
Fade away, and fade into the sand.<br>
The prayers, the rusted faiths<br>
And the dreams are gone.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Leave me alone now,<br>
Alone now,<br>
I'm sick and tired of what you want from me.<br>
Leave me alone now<br>
Just go now.<br>
Finally I want to have some peace.<br>
<br>
Don't know where they disappeared<br>
The lullabies and glory years<br>
How I wish they're back to me someday.<br>
<br>
Sacrifice this brave but hungry man,<br>
Who desired to make the world<br>
But the dreams are gone.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Leave me alone now,<br>
Alone now,<br>
I'm sick and tired of what you want from me.<br>
Leave me alone now<br>
Just go now.<br>
Finally I want to have some peace.<br>
<br>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br>
(Rise in) desolation<br>
And not to fade away<br>
It's not what I thought of<br>
And not what they said.<br>
Hope there was another day<br>
That I could live.<br>
And I will give my whole life,<br>
To see another glimpse...<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus] x2</i><br>
Leave me alone now,<br>
Alone now,<br>
I'm sick and tired of what you want from me.<br>
Leave me alone now<br>
Just go now.<br>
Finally I want to have some peace.<br>
