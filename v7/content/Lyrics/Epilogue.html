Can you feel it<br>
A soul that is inside?<br>
Can you see it<br>
This wounds of the dying?<br>
<br>
It's me I feel, it's me inside<br>
This walls are closing from behind.<br>
Fallen leaves, winter storms<br>
What went right and what went wrong.<br>
<br>
That I felt it all inside me<br>
Why to hide desires?<br>
Never got it, never wanted<br>
Why a cruel satire?<br>
<br>
Can you feel it<br>
A soul that is inside?<br>
Can you see it<br>
This wounds of the dying?<br>
<br>
Can you take the pain inside<br>
And give me one more day of life<br>
All I make are the same mistakes<br>
Losing love but not the faith.<br>
<br>
That I'll take it, lock inside me<br>
Why to hide desires?<br>
Never built it, never broken<br>
Why a cruel satire?<br>
<br>
Can you feel it<br>
A soul that is inside?<br>
Can you see it<br>
This wounds of the dying?<br>
