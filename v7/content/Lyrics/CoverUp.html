It's another day, another cover up,<br>
It hurts down the deepest parts<br>
In another way, another story to tell<br>
When this time will freeze for a while<br>
A caress hand will take care of your mind<br>
For once this withered moon<br>
Will be yours and darkness mine<br>
<br>
For Once<br>
There's no fallacy<br>
What for keeping faith if chain is breaking in <br>
Split thoughts play heartache<br>
And no sanity<br>
There's no keeping faith if chain is breaking in <br>
<br>
It's another day, another cover up<br>
It takes a thousand words<br>
For another play, another ending to tell<br>
Take a bow and the curtain falls<br>
My troubled hand wipes infucated face <br>
And it's time for me to play<br>
The part I've left, the part I've left<br>
<br>
For Once<br>
There's no fallacy<br>
What for keeping faith if chain is breaking in <br>
Split thoughts play heartache<br>
And no sanity<br>
There's no keeping faith if chain is breaking in <br>
