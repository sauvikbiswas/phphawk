I smell the domination,<br>
Manufactured explanations.<br>
Speeches and lectures sound like<br>
Aggravated constitution.<br>
Once more a declaration<br>
For a civil infiltration.<br>
You stretch it all beyond the coast.<br>
Walk away from the things that matter most!<br>
<br>
You are colorblind how do you paint it red? <br>
You can't find the trail of this wasted shame.<br>
You will call the beast,<br>
You will bifurcate.<br>
All our lives are caught in this ignorance.<br>
<br>
We take the domination<br>
Justify our desperation.<br>
short word for queued up questions,<br>
Proliferation extradition.<br>
Puppets and corpses we are<br>
Strings that bind our locomotion.<br>
You buy us and we pay the cost.<br>
Who's gonna pay for all that's lost?<br>
<br>
A child's dreams are redrawn<br>
Sculpted with the pseudo-vision.<br>
And he grows up to be<br>
One amongst the population.<br>
A world eradicated,<br>
Cleaned up all human emotion.<br>
Were we promised of this day?<br>
Is it the price we all have paid?<br>
<br>
You are colorblind how do you paint it red? <br>
You can't find the trail of this wasted shame.<br>
You will call the beast,<br>
You will bifurcate.<br>
All our lives are caught in this ignorance.<br>
