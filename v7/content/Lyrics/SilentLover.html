Laid my head on the blades of green grass<br>
Smell of unrest homeward bound<br>
Trails that lay cold and forgotten<br>
Perceive and smell, someone's around.<br>
<br>
Guised in black hood, myself copied<br>
Raises arm and the truth he narrates<br>
"I am but a shade of your making,<br>
Time shall tick and one shall stay"<br>
<br>
How am I supposed to untangle<br>
This riddle played in blacks and whites?<br>
One me begs to turn my way around<br>
Another points to a hell bound flight.<br>
<br>
Inanimate body on blades of green grass<br>
Orchid smell conquers the rotten<br>
Black hood me wins the battle<br>
The other me is soon forgotten.<br>
<br>
One truth stands godforsaken<br>
An ode to a silent lover<br>
One hood stays unmistakable<br>
One gets burned, one uncovers<br>
<br>
Seek not peace of mind<br>
Nor counterfeited words of grief<br>
Sorrow's not my godsend present<br>
Another world shall wait for me.<br>
<br>
Lives are just illusions my friend<br>
The hooded you shall set you free<br>
Terminate one painful event<br>
"Death is a twin born with thee".<br>
<br>
One truth stands godforsaken<br>
An ode to a silent lover<br>
One hood stays unmistakable<br>
One gets burned, one uncovers<br>
