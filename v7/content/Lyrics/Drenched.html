Looking back the ultraviolent fame<br>
Egos clash in a supersteller way<br>
One last search and end to gloomy day<br>
Somehow it's time to feel the shame<br>
<br>
I tried and I looked into the rain<br>
My all burdens disappeared<br>
I was feeling wet again.<br>
I'm drenched in stormy drops of life<br>
Reborn in a deadly trench<br>
Flooded by the times.<br>
<br>
What's faith when it's meant to die?<br>
What's trust in this deadway town?<br>
One hope of what I ever said.<br>
What's dream and how it's gonna mend?<br>
<br>
I tried and I looked into the rain<br>
My all burdens disappeared<br>
I was feeling wet again.<br>
I'm drenched in stormy drops of life<br>
Reborn in a deadly trench<br>
Flooded by the times.<br>
<br>
Did you say you ever loved me?<br>
Did you ever break to cry?<br>
Did you think I'd lay my head down?<br>
Turn my back and say goodbye.<br>
Did you read the lines on my face?<br>
Did you stop to take the air?<br>
One last time to look back<br>
Trace the things that we shared.<br>
<br>
I tried and I looked into the rain<br>
My all burdens disappeared<br>
I was feeling wet again.<br>
I'm drenched in stormy drops of life<br>
Reborn in a deadly trench<br>
Flooded by the times.<br>
