Tomorrow, they may build another wall<br>
Tomorrow might be short to live and too long a fall<br>
Tomorrow might be afterlife for ones who decay<br>
Tomorrow the sky may pour and wash their sins away<br>
<br>
Tomorrow, the sun may not shine<br>
What's the point in the news today, it's the weatherman's sky<br>
Tomorrow might fabricate just like yesterday<br>
Silly minds of silly people and silly games they play<br>
<br>
Silence before the storm,<br>
And then silence shall fall again.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow you may run your race alone<br>
And the one who knows, the turns to take is the stranger on the phone.<br>
Tomorrow may be aftermath of a gurantee of lies<br>
'Cause overrated future gives you rights to survive.<br>
<br>
Silence before the storm,<br>
And then silence shall fall again.<br>
