One soul fighting hard,<br>
One to raise champagne<br>
Branded with unrest<br>
Does the heart beat the same?<br>
We are a generation<br>
Carrying this shame.<br>
Sleepless nights of thoughts<br>
To start a fight again.<br>
<br>
No sense to cut round the corner.<br>
Small steps that rise so higher.<br>
Jack makes all his moves<br>
To squeeze the world that he took.<br>
One glimpse of tragedy<br>
And turn our backs - we all are liars.<br>
Never give nor we spare<br>
Smile that wished to be there.<br>
<br>
In this story fairies will die.<br>
The evil side is north and everything's bright.<br>
To die for freedom or for name.<br>
Pick your side up - we'll play this game.<br>
<br>
Higher, higher, we climb on fallen bodies.<br>
Liar, liar, sweet words that we speak.
Higher, higher, we climb on fallen bodies.<br>
Fire, fire, burns now beneath my feet.<br>
<br>
What answers can we give<br>
To a generation that follows?<br>
We'll file all our deeds<br>
In blood red hands and dirty feet.<br>
This tale is not for the weak.<br>
Death took a toll on the fairies.<br>
One pass to evil side,<br>
One leads North and one is bright.<br>
<br>
Did we all listen, did we all try?<br>
One is for money and the rest is for pride.<br>
You always look to the other side.<br>
The sea looks calm but wait till the tide.<br>
<br>
Higher, higher, we climb on fallen bodies.<br>
Liar, liar, sweet words that we speak.<br>
Higher, higher, we climb on fallen bodies.<br>
Fire, fire, burns now beneath my feet.<br>
<br>
Jump, to touch the sky, to live a life, that's all we try.<br>
Faith of what is left behind, yeah one more try, one more try.<br>
<br>
Did we all listen, did we all try?<br>
One is for money and the rest is for pride.<br>
You always look to the other side.<br>
The sea looks calm but wait till the tide.<br>
<br>
Higher, higher, we climb on fallen bodies.<br>
Liar, liar, sweet words that we speak.<br>
Higher, higher, we climb on fallen bodies.<br>
Fire, fire, burns now beneath my feet.<br>
