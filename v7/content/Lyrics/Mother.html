Born as a rebel, I turn the heavens with your touch<br>
Every little single time I don't spill the promise much.<br>
I'm still trying to get to a point you want me to be.<br>
I still remember how much you fought the hell for me.<br>
But don't you feel that I'm not ever feeling hard<br>
'Cause sometimes I just feel like I'm falling apart.<br>
<br>
Got this life,<br>
Every step to fight<br>
I'm back with the hunch, a feeling that cuts inside.<br>
You'll be there showing me a way.<br>
'Cause I'm not stopping 'till I see the end.<br>
<br>
There were days when togetherness was a must for me.<br>
But now I know that you were always into me.<br>
Got through hell reached a place that was so vague,<br>
Thought to change but this world was too much to take.<br>
But I didn't ever think about the promises,<br>
'Cause they were just right there where you wanted them.<br>
<br>
Got this life,<br>
Every step to fight<br>
I'm back with the hunch, a feeling that cuts inside.<br>
You'll be there showing me a way.<br>
'Cause I'm not stopping 'till I see the end.<br>
<br>
'Till I see the end...<br>
Why did you fight for the things that you coudn't face.<br>
<br>
But don't you feel that I'm not ever feeling hard<br>
'Cause sometimes I just feel like I'm falling apart.<br>
<br>
Got this life,<br>
Every step to fight<br>
I'm back with the hunch, a feeling that cuts inside.<br>
You'll be there showing me a way.<br>
'Cause I'm not stopping 'till I see the end.<br>
