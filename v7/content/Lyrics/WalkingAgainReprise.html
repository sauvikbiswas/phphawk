All the joy, all the pain,<br>
Through your footprints I walk again.<br>
Envy strides, feelings cry,<br>
But maybe I have lost again.<br>
I don't care how I connect<br>
To the places I had to be<br>
What they say, I don't pray,<br>
I can't see my past again.<br>

All the joy, all the pain,<br>
Through your footprints I walk again.<br>
Envy strides, feelings cry,<br>
Maybe I'll never lose again.<br>
I don't care how I connect<br>
To the places I had to be<br>
What they say, I don't pray,<br>
I won't see my past again.<br>
