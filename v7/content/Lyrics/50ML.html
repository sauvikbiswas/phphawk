And when the end is near,<br>
And you thought you have fought your fears<br>
Ornamental and political smears<br>
It's been a way your life has steered.<br>
You're standing here all alone in the crowd<br>
Hearing the voices you're trying to reach out<br>
You know now there's just no way out<br>
You wish that you could scream it just a bit loud.<br>
<br>
It's just the dusk,<br>
It's just the way<br>
Of the rising Sun to say,<br>
Keep moving on<br>
Beg to survive<br>
In these dark ways called life<br>
<br>
You remember all the fallacies in steps<br>
You kind of fall deeper within<br>
You discover that you just fought a war<br>
A soldier loses life in an amnesic world<br>
Oh my lord there's so much to cry<br>
Your son is just too young left now to fight<br>
Your daughter coughs and wife leaves behind<br>
But she too will be looking the stars in the sky.<br>
<br>
O! Captain,<br>
This blood is running in veins<br>
I can see the heaven close shut the door.<br>
Can't you see that I'm down with the ache of my life?<br>
All I'm asking for is 50 ml more.<br>
<br>
Never thought for a while<br>
That this one shot could make you to die.<br>
Promises, dreams you've made<br>
Will just go away, just go away (in vain)<br>
<br>
O! Captain,<br>
My soul will be rightly in place<br>
Ten years and I'm tired of this gore.<br>
Hope you see that I'm down with the ache of my life.<br>
Now I'm asking for please 50 ml more.<br>
