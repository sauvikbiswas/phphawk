Some place hidden underneath<br>
A pile of empty open cans,<br>
We find solace in the stars<br>
Obscured by a darkened sky.<br>
No ties to bind the animal.<br>
No fence to mark a line of peace.<br>
We live in dystopia-<br>
No laws but rules do dictate.<br>
<br>
We stepped on the Razor's Edge.<br>
We fought with a broken firing gun.<br>
Never gave another a chance.<br>
Pulled the trigger, shot and ran.<br>
Never fight a loser's war.<br>
There's a vulture hiding the big Sun.<br>
Hovers for someone to fall.<br>
Pulled the trigger, shot and ran.<br>
<br>
Some place hidden underneath<br>
Pages, memories to turn.<br>
Once real, now a ghost of dreams<br>
A world so hypothetical.<br>
No roads to sanitarium.<br>
No place I would call my own.<br>
Asphalt stuck on my both soles<br>
Like rules we never get rid of.<br>
<br>
We are frozen in a slice<br>
Between glassy walls of time.<br>
Lead that punches through the heart.<br>
Makes way to break the broken glass.<br>
<br>
We stepped on the Razor's Edge.<br>
We fought with a broken firing gun.<br>
Never gave another a chance.<br>
Pulled the trigger, shot and ran.<br>
Never fight a loser's war.<br>
There's a vulture hiding the big Sun.<br>
Hovers for someone to fall.<br>
Pulled the trigger, shot and ran.<br>
