Doesn't really matter if they rate you down,<br>
You feel bad when someone else is crowned.<br>
It doesn't really matter if its dark again,<br>
There's nobody to be called your friend.<br>
<br>
It doesn't really matter if its broken down<br>
Your dream of love,<br>
You try your best to call her out<br>
But no one transcends.<br>
<br>
All the joy, all the pain,<br>
Through your footprints I walk again.<br>
Envy strides, feelings cry,<br>
But maybe I have lost again.<br>
I don't care how I connect<br>
To the places I had to be<br>
What they say, I don't pray,<br>
I can't see my past again.<br>
<br>
The days are going like hours long.<br>
The nights are filled with hopeless thoughts<br>
You cry out and you shout at yourself<br>
To bring back that lost past again.<br>
<br>
Faith is lost to live this life,<br>
It's so hard.<br>
Destination seems to have lost its face<br>
And I feel so down...<br>
<br>
All the joy, all the pain,<br>
Through your footprints I walk again.<br>
Envy strides, feelings cry,<br>
But maybe I have lost again.<br>
I don't care how I connect<br>
To the places I had to be<br>
What they say, I don't pray,<br>
I can't see my past again.<br>
