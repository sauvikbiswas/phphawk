It was mid-December,<br>
The snow was shrinking into him.<br>
He couldn't lose his thoughts<br>
Once again to this myth he sings.<br>
<br>
Winter is the warmth of home,<br>
Cold inside the cell he sleeps.<br>
How could he possibly<br>
Cheat this hail, maybe cheat this hail.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
He was all illusioned up,<br>
With arguments he can't refute.<br>
Maybe he has strength to live,<br>
To live this life in solitude.<br>
<br>
Shaken faiths and sanity,<br>
Darker are the dreams he makes.<br>
Will it be the end of hope<br>
Why dream today? Maybe, dream today.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Hear the whisper - the sound of me,<br>
All the way this fatal tragedy.<br>
It's a madness thats haunts when you die,<br>
Reincarnation of my dreams.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus] : </i><br>
Solitude, Lonliness<br>
Is all that I can take<br>
All alone, left to die<br>
I'm not weak inside<br>
Thoughts of hope, thoughts of faith<br>
Won't ease the ache<br>
Sometime, some day<br>
I'll fly away.<br>
