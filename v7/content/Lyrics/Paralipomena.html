I was born to wander free<br>
Freedom gifted by design<br>
Empty lies smell a hallmark of truth<br>
Promised world is a filth divine.<br>
<br>
Broken, I am left behind.<br>
Was I meant to be a spare?<br>
There's a link that binds us together<br>
Cut me loose if you don't care.<br>
<br>
And I wonder if our roads would meet again.<br>
And I wonder if you'd carry me all the way.<br>
And I wonder if there's no way back again.<br>
Would you mind if I... Would you mind if I stay.<br>
<br>
Something overrules me<br>
Tries to bind me in a chain.<br>
No matter how hard I try to be free<br>
A link then rejoins again.<br>
<br>
And I wonder should our roads ever meet again.<br>
And I wonder if you'd then recognize me.<br>
And I wonder if I'll drown in my past again.<br>
Would you mind if I'm... Would you mind if I'm free.<br>
