<img src="images/sudipto.gif" align="left" style="padding: 0px 15px 10px 0px;">Sudipto a.k.a. 'DJ' is one of the founding members of DP, he is voice of the band - both on stage and off. He has been singing ever since he can remember - it's either that or he is suffering from some retrograde amnesia. Since he is just a vocalist, he is immune to gear acquisition syndrome and prefers a simple, acoustic guitar to write most of the songs. He has a gifted Shure SM57 to carry out all his vocal works. His influences have shifted over the years from Darren Hayes to Bon Jovi to Chester Bennington to Myles Kennedy to Brandon Boyd and hence by extrapolation, to a now anonymous singer, yet to be discovered. He is often responsible for coming up with intricate vocal harmonies that are a trademark in DP's studio offerings. Sudipto works for a multi national software company in Bangalore. Loves hanging out with his friends and is a 'responsible' person in terms of any work that he takes up. He is an excellent cook and often feeds the band when at his house. One should try out his trademark "Chili Chicken".
